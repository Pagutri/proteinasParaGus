# proteinasParaGus

Genetic Algorithms for the optimization of the tertiary structure of a 2D model of proteins.

The model consists of a chain of aminoacids. The algorithm looks for the tertiary structure that minimizes energy and prevents
hydrophobic aminoacids from touching the water as much as it cans.
